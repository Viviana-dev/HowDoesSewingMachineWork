**[dataset.csv](dataset.csv):**

- Row for every unique script task and step
- Columns:
	- Paths to corresponding video files in third person (`tpv_filepath`), first person (`fpv_filepath`) and with eye tracking annotations as circle (`fpv_circle_filepath`) and as an attention map (`fpv_attention_filepath`)
	- Path to corresponding audio file (`audio_filepath`)
	- Audio transcription (`transcript`)

**[human_qa.csv](human_qa.csv):**

- Row for every question answer pair formulated by human annotators
- Columns:
	- Human formulated question (`question`)
	- Human formulated answer (`correct_answer`)
	- Task (`task`) and step (`step`) of script corresponding to the question
	- Unique ID of human annotator (`participant_id`)
	- Submission time of question and answer (`created_at`)
	- Annotation whether QA pair is useable (`acceptable`)
	- Annotation of reasoning type (`reasoning`):
		- `KNOWLEDGE`
		- `SPATIAL`
		- `TEMPORAL`
		- `PERCEPTION`
	- Unique ID of QA pair (`qa_id`)

**[gemini_qa.csv](gemini_qa.csv):**

- Row for every answer generated by Gemini 1.5 Pro
- Columns:
	- Task (`task`) and step (`step`) of script corresponding to the question
	- Corresponding instructions for task and step (`instructions`)
	- Paths to corresponding video files in third person (`tpv_filepath`), first person (`fpv_filepath`) and with eye tracking annotations as circle (`fpv_circle_filepath`) 
	- Unique ID of human QA pair annotator (`participant_id`)
	- Annotation whether human QA pair is useable (`acceptable`)
	- Annotation of reasoning type for human QA pair (`reasoning`):
	- Human formulated question (`question`)
	- Human formulated answer (`correct_answer`)
	- Unique ID of QA pair (`qa_id`)
	- Model generated answer (`gemini_answer`)
	- Manual annotation whether model generated answer is acceptable (`gemini_acceptable`)
	- Type of ablation setting used for prompts (`ablation setting`):
		- `naive baseline`: no context beyond question
		- `TPV`: TPV video as context
		- `FPV`: FPV video as context
		- `FPV_C`: FPV video with circle annotation for eye tracking as context
		- `FPV_A`: FPV video with attention map for eye tracking as context
    	- `text-only reference model`: textual instructions related to question as context
